# 🛡️ SysSage — A Lightweight System Health Monitoring CLI Tool

> **A modular shell script that audits your system’s health right from the command line — no frills, no bloat.**

---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

SysSage is designed for developers, testers, and system engineers who want a **quick, readable, and customizable** health check of their Linux or WSL environments.

Whether you're prepping for a deployment, testing automation, or just maintaining system sanity — SysSage gets it done.

🌐 Real-World Use Case

Inspired by a real-world need to:

“Run basic system health checks before builds, testing pipelines, or OS-level automation — especially inside lightweight Linux shells like WSL, where heavy monitoring tools aren't practical.”

Ideal for:
Local dev machines
CI environments
QA test systems
Internal servers
